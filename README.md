#### The project is far from completion, but is also frozen for now

### An Arduino project to make a recreation of MP3 player which is used by Persona 3 protagonist

This project uses:
 - Arduino Nano as development controller (supposed to be changed to Pro Mini 3.3v)
 - DF Player Mini as a chip that has both SD card slot and MP3 player capability, but can't read file names on SD card
 - SSD1306 OLED Display with resolution of 128x32

Also considered:
 - Li-po battery of 300-400 mAh
 - LTC4150 coulomb counter (might be overkill)
 - Voltage regulator with USB port (18650 or TP4056)
 - Almost special USB-Serial programmer to upload sketch with a tracklist of each folder

All hardware CAD files will be in it's specified folder named "hardware"
